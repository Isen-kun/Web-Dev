                I shouldn’t have read it.<br>
It was just a normal day, and it was just one of the numerous posts I clicked on. <br>
It wasn’t weird, or anything. Just another post, another random scary story that was made up by an anonymous user. It wasn’t even that terrifying. <br>
But after reading that post, it was as if something had changed in the air. I can’t even explain it... <br>
The way the air seemed to be breathing with me as I read that post creeped me out. <br>
In, out. <br>
Can you feel it? <br>
The air becoming heavy, pressing against your chest. <br>
Breathe again. Breathe slowly. <br>
And then you’ll hear it. <br>
The random sounds that you weren’t aware of. <br>
Listen closely. <br>
No, don’t tear your eyes away from the screen. Don’t look at it. <br>
Just listen. <br>
Don’t reveal that you know that it’s there. <br>
Just listen, listen closely to the background noise. It will seem like a normal sound, maybe an electrical hum, the sound of your pets, or maybe even insects. But it’ll sound unnatural. <br>
Can you hear it? <br>
After you hear it, please, please, please, don’t look at your reflection. No, not only your mirror. Any objects that can reflect light, even if your reflection is just a hazy blur. <br>
Avoid anything at all where you can see your reflection. <br>
Because if you do, you’ll see that it’s behind you. <br>
And you won’t be able to help yourself, you will look at it. It’s a compulsion, like the way we can see at the corner of our eyes. <br>
You will see it. <br>
And once you do, it will know that you know about it. <br>
It’s hard, isn’t it? <br>
That’s why I shouldn’t have read it. <br>
And you shouldn’t have read it too. <br>
