                Last is a scary word. The last time you’ll ever see someone, for example. That aspect of it being the last ever time it will happen is scary. It won’t ever happen again, it’s scary. <br>
The last time my parents ever picked me up as a baby. <br>
The last day of preschool, which was the last time I ever saw most of my friends over there. <br>
The last day of elementary school, which was the last time I ever saw some of those friends. <br>
But first is scary too, and when paired with last it can become sad. The first time ever doing something, doing something new, can be scary. <br>
The first time I ever dealt with love. <br><br>
The last day of middle school. <br><br>
The first day of high school. <br><br>
The last time I ever dealt with love before giving up. <br><br>
The last day of high school. <br><br>
My first time in my own house. <br><br>
My family’s last time seeing me before I went back to my own house. <br><br>
My last ever text. <br><br>
My last ever time picking up that knife. <br><br>
My last tears. <br><br>
